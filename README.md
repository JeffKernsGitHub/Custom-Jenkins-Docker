# Jenkins Docker Study
[Github](https://github.com/JeffKernsGitHub/Custom-Jenkins-Docker)

## Purpose

A customer was interested in Containerization so I performed this study to create and deploy Jenkins in a Docker container.

## Goals

### Scope

- Create a Docker Image based on the current Jenkins stable image and add the customer required Oracle JDK 11 which was required by the customer.

- Create a Docker Volume for the container to use that is detached from the container that allows Jenkins to be upgraded and reattached to it's Jenkins home.

- Deploy the developed container and have it work.

### Next Steps

Outside of this simple study and topics for other studies:

- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) or image repositories were not used.

- No attempt was made to host using SSL/TLS. The focus was on containerization.

-  No hardening or image static analysis was performed.

## Tools Used
[VSCodium with Docker Extension](https://vscodium.com/)

[Docker Desktop (development), Docker Engine (Server)](https://www.docker.com/)

[Oracle VirtualBox to guest Fedora Server](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

[Fedora Server 41](https://fedoraproject.org/server/)

## Building
Used the VSCodium Docker extension to build the Dockerfile into an Image.

### Create Volume
Created the Docker Volume in Docker Desktop. Alternatively:
```bash
docker volume create jenkins-data
```

### Create Container
Created the container by running the Image from Docker Desktop with the following options:

- Mapped port 8080:8080

- Mapped /var/jenkins_home to the jenkins-data volume

- Gave the container a reasonable name: customjenkinsdocker:latest

Note: Server installation section provides a CLI example

I verified that the Volume populated and restarted the Container and verified that changes held.

## Packaging and Deployment

### Server Creation

In VirtualBox, created a Fedora Server 41 guest:

- 6G RAM

- 40G Disk

- Port forwarded host 2222 to guest 22

- Port forwarded host 8080 to guest 8080

 Updated dnf and installed the Docker Engine per current documentation.

### Export Volume and Container for transfer to another server 

I stopped the running container for these steps.
 
#### Backup Volume

##### Create Temporary Container with the Volume mounted

Docker Desktop terminal was used in this step.

Created a temporary container with the jenkins-data volume mounted.

This command created a Ubuntu container named sample-container with the jenkins-data volume mapped as /data. In hindsight, adding the --rm option may have been advised so it would have self-cleaned.

```bash
run -d --name sample-container -v jenkins-data:/data ubuntu
```

Created a tarball with the Volume's Contents

- it attaches to the created sample-container

- my home folder is mapped to a /backup-dir alias 

- a jenkins-data.tar.gz tarball was created in my home, not in a subdirectory

```bash
run --rm --volumes-from sample-container -v /home/jeffkerns:/backup-dir ubuntu tar cvzf /backup-dir/jenkins-data.tar.gz /data
```


##### Backup the Jenkins Container

Docker Desktop terminal was used in this step.

Listed all Containers 

```
docker ps -a
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                        COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS                        PORTS     NAMES
940d03cd0ea0   customjenkinsdocker:latest   "/usr/bin/tini -- /uâ€¦"   7 hours ago   Exited (143) 34 minutes ago             MyJenkins
```

Committed the Image to the Docker repository

```
jeffkerns@cyberdeck:~$ docker commit -p 940d03cd0ea0 jenkins-02nov2024
sha256:64821ea5b0c10bd054e800b5c068436856de235aecd61fb3856743a9ca13ff37
```

Exported the image to a tarball 

```bash
docker save -o  jenkins-02nov2024.tar jenkins-02nov2024
```

### Restore the container and volume tarballs on the Fedora Server

#### Copy the tarballs to the server

This step was performed in a local terminal.

```bash
scp -P 2222 jenkins-02nov2024.tar root@127.0.0.1:/root
scp -P 2222 jenkins-data.tar.gz root@127.0.0.1:/root
``` 


#### Restore the Volume

This step was performed shelled into the server.

First, I created a docker Volume on the server. Then, I extracted the tarball into the volume using essentially the reverse process of creating the backup.

```bash
docker volume create jenkins-data

docker run --rm -v jenkins-data:/data -v $(pwd):/backup-dir ubuntu tar xvzf /backup-dir/jenkins-data.tar.gz -C /
```

#### Restore the Container

This step was performed shelled into the server.

Created an Image from the tarball.
